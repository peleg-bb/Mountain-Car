# Mountain Car
In this project I implemented Gymnasium's Mountain Car Problem - [https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/)
We used agent-based reinforcement learning to train the model to climb up the mountain. 
The model uses SARSA to train the agent.

This was part of the Reinforcement Learning course, a voluntary master's course I took as part of my Bachelor's of Software Engineering at Ben Gurion University.
